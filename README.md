# Academic-Performance
"Attaining an academic credential presents substantial hurdles for students on a global scale. The journey is frequently intimidating. As per data from the Education Data Initiative (EDI) in 2021, approximately 40% of undergraduates withdraw from their university or college programs. What are the factors that jeopardize students' academic performance?"
The Exploratory Data Analysis was carried out in 7 categories in relation to the target variable.
The following insights were obtained after conducting the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Financial Factor: Late tuition payments and the presence of tuition debt can lead to Academic dropout.
Academic Factor: There is a high chance of Academic success when the student has a High previous qualification and admission grade.
Demographic Factor: Male students recorded a high dropout rate, and students above the Age of 23 have a higher chance of dropping out.
Enrollment Factor: The Academic process of each student recorded a Strong Positive correlation. The final phase of the academic process which is the Evaluation phase recorded a high dropout for the Males in 1st sem. and a high graduation rate for the female in 2nd sem. The relationship between the curricular units and target variable shows that they are a major factor in predicting Academic performance.
Socioeconomic Factor: Students whose parents are students and have unknown qualifications have a high chance of dropping out. Also, Married students have a high dropout rate, while single students recorded a high graduation rate.
Macroeconomic Factor: This had little to no effect on student academic success and dropout.
Application Factor: Students who meet the 1st phase general requirement have a high graduate rate, while students above 23 years old have a high dropout rate. Also, Management courses recorded a high dropout rate while Nursing recorded a high graduate rate.![Academic Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/IbehDera/Academic-Performance/assets/125457751/d577b00f-79df-4db5-a8be-61e7ef1ddc67)
